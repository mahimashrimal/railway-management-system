PROJECT DESCRIPTION:-

The topic of the project is RAILWAY BOOKING SYSTEM. The railway booking system facilitates the passengers to enquiry about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, booking and cancellation of tickets, enquiry about the status of the booked ticket, etc. The aim of the case study is to design and develop a database maintaining records of different trains , train status and passengers . this project contains introduction to railways reservation system. It is the computerized system of reserving the seats of train in advance. It is mainly used for learning all the information about the railway in advance. Online reservation has made the process for the reservation of seats very much easier than ever before. key features and considerations for  railway booking system:
1.	User Management:
•	Users are stored in the user table, containing essential information such as first name, last name, age, gender, contact number, and email.
•	User IDs serve as primary keys, ensuring a unique identifier for each user.
2.	Passenger Information:
•	The passenger table represents passengers, linked to users through a one-to-one relationship. This design allows capturing additional passenger-specific details.
•	Each passenger has a unique ticket ID generated using the passenger ID and stored in the ticket_id column.
•	Reservation status tracks the status of the passenger's booking.
3.	Train Management:
•	The train table contains details about trains, such as train name, source, destination, arrival time, and departure time.
•	Train IDs serve as primary keys, ensuring a unique identifier for each train.
4.	Train Status:
•	The trainstatus table maintains information about the status of each train, including booked seats, available seats, and waiting list details.
5.	Payment Processing:
•	Payments are recorded in the payment table, associated with passengers through a one-to-one relationship.

7.	Information Management:
•	The information table establishes a many-to-many relationship between passengers and trains, allowing for flexible association between the two entities.

Considerations:
•	Referential Integrity: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity, maintaining the relationships between tables.
•	Data Consistency: Triggers can be implemented to enforce business rules and maintain data consistency.
•	User-Friendly Features: Implementing additional features like seat selection, real-time availability, and user-friendly interfaces can enhance the user experience.
